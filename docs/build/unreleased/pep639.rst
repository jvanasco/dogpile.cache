    :tags: change, general

    Support for Python 3.8 has been dropped, the minimum version is now Python
    3.9, as 3.8 is EOL.   This change is necessitated by the need to require
    setuptools 77.0.3 in order to satisfy :pep:`639`.



.. change::
    :tags: bug, general

    The pyproject.toml configuration has been amended to use
    the updated :pep:`639` configuration for license, which eliminates
    loud deprecation warnings when building the package.   Note this
    necessarily bumps setuptools build requirement to 77.0.3 which
    forces Python 3.8 support to be dropped.
